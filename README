NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic - Basic HTTP authentication for Dancer web
    apps

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic provides basic HTTP authentication for
    Dancer web applications.

    Add the plugin to your application:

        use Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic;

    Configure the protected paths and users/passwords in the YAML
    configuration file:

        plugins:
          "Auth::Basic":
            paths:
              "/restricted":
                realm: Restricted zone
                user: alice
                password: AlicesPassword
              "/secret/data":
                users:
                  alice: AlicesPassword
                  bob: BobsPassword

    You can also call the `auth_basic' function in a before filter:

        before sub {
            auth_basic user => 'alice', password => 'AlicesPassword';
        };

    or in a route handler:

        get '/confidential' => sub {
            auth_basic realm => 'Authorized personnel only',
                users => { 'alice' => 'AlicesPassword', 'bob' => 'BobsPassword' };
        
            # Authenticated
            ...
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic adds basic HTTP authentication to Dancer web
    applications.

CONFIGURATION
    The available configuration options are listed below.

  paths
    Defines one or more paths that will be protected, including sub-paths
    (so if the path is `"/restricted"', then
    `"/restricted/secret/file.html"' will also be protected). Each path can
    have the following parameters:

    * `password'
        Password (if a single user is allowed access).

    * `realm'
        Realm name that will be displayed in the authentication dialog.
        Default: `"Restricted area"'

    * `user'
        User name (if a single user is allowed access).

    * `users'
        A list of user names and passwords (if multiple users are allowed
        access).

    Example:

        plugins:
          "Auth::Basic":
            paths:
              "/secret":
                realm: "Top secret documents"
                user: charlie
                password: CharliesPassword
              "/documents":
                realm: "Only for Bob and Tim"
                users:
                  bob: BobsPassword
                  tim: TimsPassword

  users
    Defines top-level users and their passwords. These users can access all
    paths configured using the `paths' option.

    Example:

        plugins:
          "Auth::Basic":
            users:
              fred: FredsPassword
              jim: JimsPassword
          
PASSWORDS
    Passwords in configuration files can be written as clear text, or in any
    scheme that is recognized by Authen::Passphrase (either in RFC 2307 or
    crypt encoding).

    Example:

         plugins:
          "Auth::Basic":
            users:
              # Clear text
              tom: TomsPassword
              # MD5 hash, RFC 2307 encoding
              ben: "{MD5}X8/UHlR6EiFbFz/0f903OQ=="
              # Blowfish, crypt encoding
              ryan: "$2a$08$4DqiF8T1kUfj.nhxTj2VhuUt1ZX8L.y4aNA3PCAjWLfLEZCw8r0ei"          

FUNCTIONS
  auth_basic
    This function may be called in a before filter or at the beginning of a
    route handler. It checks if the client is authorized to access the
    requested path -- if not, it immediately returns a 401 Unauthorized
    response to prompt the user to authenticate.

        auth_basic realm => 'Top secret', user => 'alice',
            password => 'AlicesPassword';

    Parameters:

    * `realm'
        Realm name that will be displayed in the authentication dialog.
        Default: `"Restricted area"'

    * `password'
        Password (if a single user is allowed access).

    * `user'
        User name (if a single user is allowed access).

    * `users'
        A hash reference mapping user names to passwords (if multiple users
        are allowed access).
